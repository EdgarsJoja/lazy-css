Lazy CSS
---

Drop-in CSS library (file) for zero effort webpage design.

See demo [here](https://edgarsjoja.github.io/lazy-css/).

### How to use

Take `lazy.css` file and add it to your project.

That's it!

### Override Colors

Lazy CSS uses just 2 colors for styling - primary & secondary.

You can easily override them:

```css
:root {
    --lazy-color-primary: orange;
    --lazy-color-secondary: red;
}
```
